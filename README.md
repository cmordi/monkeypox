# Monkeypox
Exploratory Data Analysis of the Monkeypox outbreak

## Things to know

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus is part of the same family of viruses as variola virus, the virus that causes smallpox. Monkeypox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms, but milder, and monkeypox is rarely fatal. Monkeypox is not related to chickenpox.

The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970. Prior to the 2022 outbreak, monkeypox had been reported in people in several central and western African countries. Previously, almost all monkeypox cases in people outside of Africa were linked to international travel to countries where the disease commonly occurs or through imported animals. These cases occurred on multiple continents.

## Steps:

1. The dataset will be scraped and loaded from a reliable and up to date source from github
2. The data will be cleaned. This means that I will attempt to remove the missing values, outliers and rows. Possibly reformat the data as well

## A few of the analysis that is being conducted

- Number of cases 
- Countries affected (ranked)
- Common symptoms 
- Age distribution
- Predictive (dataset may be too small to run a proper ML algo)
